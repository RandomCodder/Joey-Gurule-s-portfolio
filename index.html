          A 2D side scrolling game I made during my first semester of my senior year in App Academy. The game was originally going to be called Halloween run, but was renamed to Candy Collector since the development time exceeded past Halloween. The goal is to make it to past all the enemies collecting candy to get points, do not let your health go to 0, or you have to restart. Made in Godot.
