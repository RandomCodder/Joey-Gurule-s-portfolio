        One of the projects I've done in my Film History class was to make a short film of anything related to some social issue. Originally, my teacher wanted us to make a short horror film, but decided to open all the dfferent types of generes for us to make. most people did live action films, but I wanted to try and make a stop motion animation since there would be more freedom on what can happen. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The plot was something like this. A talented roboticist bulids three robots to compete in a contest for "Best robots created by a human". he also bulid a generator to build more robots with the same properties as the main three. As he releases them, something wrong ends up happening in their way of identifying humans as either safe or hostile. They end up killing the roboticist and venture outside into nature in which they will later encounter more humans to kill as well. The Film History teacher loved my short film.

        My film history teacher stated that we either follow the rules of the Hays code, a form of censorship, or we go against it, have things in it that make it PG-13 or R rated. My short film went against the Hays Code rule in which it contains onscreen violence and some swearing. I wanted this so the film can be somewhat taken seriously with how violent the robots can really get.

        The entire project was initally going to be done with the help of some family members, but later I decided to get it done completly solo, the voice acting, script, writing, story, animation, directing, and editing was all done by me. The animation software I used was the emblem editor in the videogame Call of Duty Black Ops III and the style of animation was stop motion. I wanted to use this editor since I as a person don't know how real animation works, and I only know stop motion. I also didn't have any real animation softwares capable of doing the style I wanted, so I used the emblem editor.

        As mentioned, this animation was done using the emblem editor in Call of Duty Black Ops III.
        The emblem editor is a simple way of drawing using blocks, it is notorious by the 
        community with people making NSFW content. This editor is not ment for animation, but I 
        made it work with experience of using it for a couple of personal projects I made using 
        the same editor. The issue I had with this project was time management. When the time 
        came to start making this, I was exicted, but when I got home to start, I completly forgot 
        the very slow process it took. You see, the emblem editor has a major flaw when using it 
        in which there's no option to move multiple shapes (Or layers as its called) in one go. 
        For example, the image you see on screen, I would need to move every block, or piece that 
        makes up the robot one by one into frame position. Every. Single. Time. This issue was the big buzzkill of 
        the project in a way that would make every single session an annoying process that was accompanied 
        with me pacing, being mad, and anxious. Another issue I had was the layer limitation. 
        In a canvas, you can up to 64 layers, (shapes/blocks) on screen, and that includes the background, characters,
        and the pieces that make up a person or scenery. The main characters, Greg and Nathan are examples of this issue.
        When both are on screen, they already almost reach the 64 layer limit with the addtion of where they are in the scene
        like them in a moving truck, a house, or running away from one of the robots.
