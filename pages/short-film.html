        One of the projects I've done in my Film History class was to make a short film of anything related to some social issue. Originally, my teacher wanted us to make a short horror film, but decided to open all the dfferent types of generes for us to make. most people did live action films, but I wanted to try and make a stop motion animation since there would be more freedom on what can happen. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The plot was something like this. A talented roboticist bulids three robots to compete in a contest for "Best robots created by a human". he also bulid a generator to build more robots with the same properties as the main three. As he releases them, something wrong ends up happening in their way of identifying humans as either safe or hostile. They end up killing the roboticist and venture outside into nature in which they will later encounter more humans to kill as well. The Film History teacher loved my short film.

        My film history teacher stated that we either follow the rules of the Hays code, a form of censorship, or we go against it, have things in it that make it PG-13 or R rated. My short film went against the Hays Code rule in which it contains onscreen violence and some swearing. I wanted this so the film can be somewhat taken seriously with how violent the robots can really get.

        The entire project was initally going to be done with the help of some family members, but later I decided to get it done completly solo, the voice acting, script, writing, story, animation, directing, and editing was all done by me. The animation software I used was the emblem editor in the videogame Call of Duty Black Ops III and the style of animation was stop motion. I wanted to use this editor since I as a person don't know how real animation works, and I only know stop motion. I also didn't have any real animation softwares capable of doing the style I wanted, so I used the emblem editor.

        As mentioned, this animation was done using the emblem editor in Call of Duty Black Ops III.
        The emblem editor is a simple way of drawing using blocks, it is notorious by the 
        community with people making NSFW content. This editor is not ment for animation, but I 
        made it work with experience of using it for a couple of personal projects I made using 
        the same editor. The issue I had with this project was time management. When the time 
        came to start making this, I was exicted, but when I got home to start, I completly forgot 
        the very slow process it took. You see, the emblem editor has a major flaw when using it 
        in which there's no option to move multiple shapes (Or layers as its called) in one go. 
        For example, the image you see on screen, I would need to move every block, or piece that 
        makes up the robot one by one into frame position. Every. Single. Time. This issue was the big buzzkill of 
        the project in a way that would make every single session an annoying process that was accompanied 
        with me pacing, being mad, and anxious. Another issue I had was the layer limitation. 
        In a canvas, you can up to 64 layers, (shapes/blocks) on screen, and that includes the background, characters,
        and the pieces that make up a person or scenery. The main characters, Greg and Nathan are examples of this issue.
        When both are on screen, they already almost reach the 64 layer limit with the addtion of where they are in the scene
        like them in a moving truck, a house, or running away from one of the robots.

      <p class="section-body">
        The one thing that worried me the most was getting this project finished on time. When I started working on
        this, there was less than a month left before the semester ended which left me to make an animation in one month.
        As mentioned, I don't know how real animation works so I'm not really an animator, therefore I didn't have patience 
        for this project. Along with this and the slow animation process, I was always anxious if I was even going to 
        get this project done on time.  I worked on this everyday, even on weekends, and even my work schedule was also not
        good since it was inconsistent. Some days I would spend 3 hours a day working on this, and some maybe less than 2 hours.
        Its espacially bad when you realized I didn't give myself any breaks at home so I did progress on this every single day at home
        which seriously drained my mental health, even doing the last scene while I was sick. Now even though my teacher gave me a week and a half more time than everyone,
        that was still just barely enough time to finish animating, and edit the voice acting and sound effects in the short film. I think I made this
        too long, but I wanted it to since I had a good story idea and I wanted to fully show that story on screen. I think another issue I had was lore.
        Some people has asked me what the lore of this film is. And to be honest, there isn't really any lore. I don't know how to make one 
        that made sense. I thought the lore was the roboticist making the robots and them going rogue killing everyone. This 
        film was made just for fun, and the lore part was the one thing I never considered when making this.

        Even though I look at this project as cringe (the voice acting mainly), I am proud that I did
        this animation for the class final. I never gave up on working on this and I felt determined to finish
        this from the beginning. I just only wished for that feeling during the animating part, but because of
        the slow process, I felt very grumpy until I started to edit the sound effects and soundtrack in. My only
        criticism for this short film is how stiff I made the characters, little to no movement is expressed when they are idling
        or standing still doing nothing, and there were a lack of medium close up shots used and mostly, full shots were used.

        Of course, this was my first attempt at trying to make a stop motion animation for a school assignment and I felt I didn't need to
        make it perfect to pass. It wasn't meant to be the best, it was an idea I had and I wanted to show it with my style of animation.
