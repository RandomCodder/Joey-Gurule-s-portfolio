        One of the projects I've done in my Film History class was to make a short film of anything related to some social issue. Originally, my teacher wanted us to make a short horror film, but decided to open all the dfferent types of generes for us to make. most people did live action films, but I wanted to try and make a stop motion animation since there would be more freedom on what can happen.

        The plot was something like this. A talented roboticist bulids three robots to compete in a contest for "Best robots created by a human". he also bulid a generator to build more robots with the same properties as the main three. As he releases them, something wrong ends up happening in their way of identifying humans as either safe or hostile. They end up killing the roboticist and venture outside into nature in which they will later encounter more humans to kill as well.
