            I began doing cute WALL-E fanart drawings near the start of my senior year in Figma.com after I realized how easy it is to take 
            the ellipse and rectangle and modifiy them in many ways. My first drawing was a simple happy birthday one, where WALL-E and EVE
            are in front of a cake, and have birthday hats on. My Web App teacher, Ms. Orret actually saw me working on it and she was suprised
            on how well it looked and that it was done on Figma. She asked me if I could make one for App Academy and I agreed on it. I'm glad 
            she told me to make one for her because I would then start this hobby of making WALL-E fanart just for fun for the rest of the school year.
            </p>
            <p class="section-body">
              The drawing you're seeing above this text is the one Ms. Orret told me to make. I spent around a month working on it,
              slowly adding more details to the background where WALL-E and EVE are. I wanted to create a background where they were in 
              a classroom promoting the App Academy course at PHS. When it was done, Ms. Orret loved it, she even printed out a poster form 
              for her class to see.

            <p class="section-body">
            After I finish the App Academy drawing, I felt pretty good making it. I wanted to make another cute drawing related to Halloween 
            since Halloween was around the corner at the time. I began working on it shortly after and this is the result. WALL-E and EVE are out 
            trick-or-treating at night, WALL-E is wearing a fancy suit, and EVE has red paint on her body along with fake blood and blood tears,
            she is scaring a fellow trick-or-treater as well.

            <p class="section-body">
              I spent about 2 or 3 weeks on this drawing, I wanted to do more but I didn't want to spend too much time adding details since I was getting
              bored. I did pretty good at making the drawing alive, there are people in the background, and a couple of the houses are decorated. After I was done,
              I had the courage to make more fanart to past time since I had fun making these and there were many ideas I wanted to create.

            I began doing a series of WALL-E fanart in a simple way. Some of these drawing include them kissing at the beach,
            together in the rain, at a park, and together driving. I also began putting random funny contexts in these drawings 
            such as EVE taking away Grand Theft Auto San Andreas from WALL-E, and them getting arrested for robbing a bank, why? I don't know.
            </p>
            <p class="section-body">
              Around this time, this is where I began to showcase these drawing to other people other than Ms. Orret. I showed these to
              other teachers, friends, and family. They all like how well these were designed and were impressed. Because of their feedback,
              this made wanted to make even more WALL-E fanart since people like it, and there were still many ideas to do. Since I was always caught
              up with homework, I would use the free time to make more. I tend to aim at only doing these drawing while at school, not home because I would 
              feel lazy, plus the atmosphere at school felt more better to work on my fanart.

            Overtime, my drawing somewhat got better with the shading and lighing effects. One thing I really like about using these shapes
            is that you can add shadow effects to them. One side of multiple shapes can had a shadow shade and you can modifiy it so it can have
            blur, or making it darker. Normally I do the shadow effects last after everything is added in the background, it is my favorite part of
            making my drawings because it gives them more life. Some people enjoy the shadow effects I add to them.
            </p>
            <p class="section-body">
              I sometimes try to be creative and add my own shadow effects as well such as a mirror light source (If that what its called).
              Even though it looks cool, I don't think it's that good. What I do to create the shadow effect is copy every shape that make up the characters,
              paint it black, flip it, make it transparent and give it blur, and place it. Sometimes I don't do well with my custom shadow effect because
              you are basically moving a bunch of different shapes at the same time and even though you can still modifiy them, doing it all in one can look a bit messy.

            The following year in the start of 2024, I had thoughts of giving WALL-E and EVE a kid. I made a drawing in which they 
            are holding a baby born on May 8th, 2006 (The day I was born) and are crying tears of joy. The baby's name is JAG, influenced by my initals, Joey A. Gurule. He is a blue 
            robot that resembles closely to a normal human. The character is heavly influenced with Astro bot in the videogame franchise. JAG 
            would be included in some of my drawings along with WALL-E and EVE. It basically a robot family doing fun things together. Some of my drawings that include JAG 
            is them at the beach, WALL-E and EVE hugging him, JAG cheering for his mom and dad playing basketball, and him being lifted in the air to fly together.

            <p class="section-body">
              I enjoy including JAG into my drawings because it gives the characters more life. Although it wouldn't make sense, I don't care about it. 
              It makes him along with WALL-E and EVE more cuter than before. It reminds me of my family who raised me right and cared for my safety. 
              Even though I don't include him in most drawings I do, it's always cute to add him in a normal family activity that we may do in life.

            I have done a lot of WALL-E fanart ever since my senior year in high school started and there has been some that I personally love doing and 
            enjoyed how it came out when finished. My all time favorite is Robot couple are rockstars because of how it came out. WALL-E and EVE are rockstars
            on stage wearing wigs and playing with electric guitars. I love how well the stage came out with the space blue theme and stars. I had to use a model
            to draw the Axiom space ship in the background, which I never noticed how closely it resembles to a superyacht. 


            <p class="section-body">
              My other favorites are Robot couple in the tunnel of love because of it's colors, and Robot couple play basketball.
              The tunnel of love one was made specifically for Valentines's Day and the basketball one was made for fun. My father likes the 
              basketball one the most since he likes the sport. Another favorite would be Robot couple at the beach since their is so much life
              with the people in the background and the amount of details on the beach.

            Despite making cute fanart, there has been two drawings that I've done that made some people concered. Even though 
            the fanart above looks cute, one of my friends looked at it in a way that made me wonder if those seemed to be... a 
            bit sexual. I've shown these drawings to my teachers and family and they liked it. They didn't have any wonders or concerns 
            about the theme of them at all, in fact, they think it was funny, which I didn't mind. One of my online friends however looked 
            at the two drawings above and immediately thought of sexual themes juding by his tone of voice. He also began questioning my 
            fanart fantasy of having WALL-E and EVE being put in those contexts. He even tried to find a term 
            that would even fit my WALL-E fantasy, in other words, he tried to call me a furry, but for robots. That didn't offend me since he always seem to find
            something and made adult jokes over it.



            <p class="section-body">
              I of course had no intention in making these drawings in any way sexual whatsoever. The real reason why I made these is because 
              I wanted to put them in contexts that are set the present day. Almost all of my fanart I've done has WALL-E and EVE doing things that
              we humans do on a daily basis. I've made them go to the beach with people in the background, cosplay as cowboys probably for a Hollywood film,
              WALL-E taking care of EVE while she was sick, cosplay as rockstars, and them getting married. These things are something that all of us do. 
              WALL-E giving EVE a back massage is something that a husband would do to his sick wife. I might understand the shower one, but I still wanted to do it
              cause I know it's going to still look cute in the end.

            I'm glad I started this pasttime because I love WALL-E and art in general. What started from a simple happy brithday drawing, to a poster request
            from one of my teachers, to a collection of fanart that slowly increased over time as the school year went by. The people I know and trust always loved
            how well these come out, which encoraged me to keep making more. I'm not in any art program so all of this was just made for fun and I liked it.

              It's sad that I'm going to have to turn in my school chromebooks at the end of the year because my account with all of my fanart in linked to my school account.
              Otherwise, I've had fun making the fanart, I took WALL-E and EVE in many journeys such as going to the park, the beach, cosplay as cowboys and rockstars, got married,
              and have the kid JAG. One of my teahcers even looked at them and thought, these could potentially be used in a WALL-E sequel.
