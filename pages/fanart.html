            I began doing cute WALL-E fanart drawings near the start of my senior year in Figma.com after I realized how easy it is to take 
            the ellipse and rectangle and modifiy them in many ways. My first drawing was a simple happy birthday one, where WALL-E and EVE
            are in front of a cake, and have birthday hats on. My Web App teacher, Ms. Orret actually saw me working on it and she was suprised
            on how well it looked and that it was done on Figma. She asked me if I could make one for App Academy and I agreed on it. I'm glad 
            she told me to make one for her because I would then start this hobby of making WALL-E fanart just for fun for the rest of the school year.

              I wanted to create this because I thought it was a cool idea. A lot of people in my class
              made games which was fine, but I wanted to create something that was related to a real life issue,
              in which it was people in poverty. This idea was well respected from my teacher and others
              because the idea was so wholesome.
