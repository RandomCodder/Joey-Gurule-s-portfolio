            The first big project I did in my high school. This project is a mobile app that I designed 
            in Figma.com in which the goal is to find homeless people, locate and give them food. There are screens that 
            featured a map to locate, person's bio, statistics, and a separate map to locate restaurants.
            The restaurants would have a care package of food given at a lower price for the user to order to 
            give it to the homeless.

              I wanted to create this because I thought it was a cool idea. A lot of people in my class
              made games which was fine, but I wanted to create something that was related to a real life issue,
              in which it was people in poverty. This idea was well respected from my teacher and others
              because the idea was so wholesome.

            The learning material was interesting. We went over everything we needed to know to make
            an app in Figma.com. This was my first time using the website so there was a bit to cover.
            We went over how to make frames, how to import icons to our prototpye, how CSS worked, how to 
            add nodes to navigate from screen to screen, and how to run tests on the prototype.

              At first, I was a bit overwhelmed with how much info I needed to take in, but then I realized
              that when you learn it, its mostly copy paste info, just different text.
